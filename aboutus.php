<h2>About Us:</h2>
<div id="tab"><em><big>Welcome</em></big> to a new kind of gym. We may be the new gym on the scene but we still have an old school philosophy, our members will always come first. 
Here at Bold's Gym we dedicate ourselves to our valued members.
<p>We started in back in 2013 in Roanoke, VA. We started with one health club and over the past few years have grown to be all over Virginia. 
We are the fastest growing health club in the area. With more than 200 clubs now we are showing the great state of Virginia how much we care about our members.
 <p>We offer classes where we work close with our members and give them our undivided attention. 
 We understand that every person that joins our gym is an individual and they will have their own set of needs.
<p>Our trainers will spend time with you to find out what exactly works for you. Our trainers have been working in this business for a long time and are 
very dedicated to improving the health of others. </p>
